Task 1: Front-End (Estimated Time: 1 hour)
Description: Using Vue.js, create a responsive front-end interface that allows users to input their attic dimensions (length, width, and height), roof slope (optional), and select the desired insulation R-value from a dropdown menu. The interface should include a "Calculate" button which, when clicked, sends the input data to the back-end and displays the calculated volume of insulation needed, received from the back-end.

Objective: This task aims to evaluate the candidate's understanding of responsive design, proficiency with Vue.js, and ability to make API calls from the front-end.

Task 2: Back-End (Estimated Time: 1 hour)
Description: Using Laravel, create a simple RESTful API. Your API should receive attic dimensions and the desired R-value as inputs and return the calculated insulation volume. Your API should have at least one endpoint: POST /calculate, which accepts attic dimensions and R-value as request data, and returns the calculated insulation volume.

Objective: This task is designed to assess the candidate's competency in Laravel, understanding of RESTful principles, and their ability to build APIs that accurately process input data and return the correct responses.
